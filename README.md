## Practicum 3 - Identifier Naming in Java

**BACKGROUND**<br>
Different programming languages have their own rules for identifier
naming. An `identifier` is a name that a programmer chooses for
a newly defined item in a program, such as variables,
functions and programmer-defined classes.

In Java, identifiers must obey the following rules:

- identifiers can only use the symbols a-z, A-Z, digits and the underscore character.
- identifiers cannot begin with a digit
- idenifiers are `case sensitive` (i.e., `num` is a different identifer than `Num`).

**WHAT TO DO**<br>
Make the identifier-related changes needed for the program to correctly execute.
